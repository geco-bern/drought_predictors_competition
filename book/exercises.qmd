## Drought prediction model

- How can you improve the model used to predict fLUE in @sec-drought-prediction? 
- Implement at least one of method to improve the model used.
  - Hand in your `*.Rmd` and `*.html` as usual.

- Demonstrate improved model skill by submitting your model results to our internal leaderboard
  - The leaderboard requires you to submit a CSV file with your fLUE predicted values for the test data set
    - Training data can be downloaded [in the data subfolder](https://github.com/geco-bern/drought_predictors_competition)
    - Test data (out-of-sample) can be downloaded [in the data subfolder](https://github.com/geco-bern/drought_predictors_competition), note that this does not contain the target values of fLUE
    - Submissions should be made as a **pull request** to the [AGDS2 course repository](https://github.com/geco-bern/agds2_course)
    - Your CSV file with labels should be stored in `data/leaderboard/fLUE_fall_2025/[username]_results.csv`
    - The file should be named `[username]_results.csv` (replace [username] with your github username)
