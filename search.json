    "text": "2.1 Data exploration\nUnderstanding drivers of drought stress in vegetation can help predict stress in space or under future conditions.\nIn the below example we use the fractional Light Use Efficiency (fLUE) as a proxy for vegetation stress. It describes reductions in the light use efficiency of plants. These reductions can be due to various stressors such as drought (soil or air), nutrient limitations, heat, etc. For simplicity we assume for our interpretation that the reductions in our data set are linked to soil drought.\nThe fLUE data were derived from measurements from eddy covariance sites from the Fluxnet network.\nOur goal is to build a model that predicts the fractional Light Use Efficiency (fLUE) using predictors that are widely available through satellite remote sensing or climate reanalysis (ERA5Land) data sets.\nWe build our model with a training data set, that contains 70 sites. Cross-validation Eventually, the model is then evaluated on the test data set. Note that this exercise is part of a amicable competition so we withheld the true target values in the test data set. Please make your predictions for the test data set using your best performing model and submit them to the leaderboard webpage as instructed in the last code block below (under tab ‘For Exercises’).\nWe start by loading the necessary libraries and the pre-processed data set.\n# random forest with leave-group of sites-out CV, \n#                  no initial split, \n#                  comprehensive hp tuning\n\n# load the ecosystem\nlibrary(caret)\nlibrary(ranger)\nlibrary(rlang)  # ← required for sym()\nlibrary(purrr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(tictoc)\nlibrary(recipes)\nlibrary(vip)\nlibrary(themis)\n# remotes::install_github(\"geco-bern/rgeco\")\nlibrary(rgeco)\n\n# for reproducibilty\nset.seed(0)\n\n## Read data --------------------------------------------------------\ndf_raw &lt;- read_rds(here(\"../data/competition2025_training_data.rds\"))\nWe have a first look at our target variable fLUE. We consider values below 1 to be drought related and color them red. Note how the different sites in our data set show different ranges and regularities of low fLUE values. This is likely related to different climates and different vegetation types at these sites.\nggplot(drop_na(df_raw, is_flue_drought), \n       aes(x=date, y=flue, \n           color = is_flue_drought, \n           group = site)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  scale_colour_manual(\"Drought\", \n                      values = c(\"TRUE\"=\"red\",\"FALSE\"=\"black\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~site) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  scale_x_date(\"date\", date_labels = \"%Y\", \n               breaks = as.Date(c(\"2005-01-01\", \"2015-01-01\")))#date_breaks = \"10 years\")\nOur model should learn about these different conditions by the predictor variables that we provide. If we look at the data set df_raw we find the following variables present:\n# TARGETS: ======\n# flue : fractional light use efficiency, a measure of \n#        (drought) stress (our target variable)\n\n# META DATA: ======\n# site : Fluxnet site name\n# date : date\n# is_flue_drought : a flag for drought conditions based on fLUE \n#                   (not to be used as predictor)\n\n# PREDICTORS: ======\n# NR_B1 : MODIS normalised reflectance band 1, 620–670nm (-)\n# NR_B2 : MODIS normalised reflectance band 2, 841–876nm (-)\n# NR_B3 : MODIS normalised reflectance band 3, 459–479nm (-)\n# NR_B4 : MODIS normalised reflectance band 4, 545–565nm (-)\n# NR_B5 : MODIS normalised reflectance band 5, 1230–1250nm (-)\n# NR_B6 : MODIS normalised reflectance band 6, 1628–1652nm (-)\n# NR_B7 : MODIS normalised reflectance band 7, 2105–2155nm (-)\n# LST : Land surface temperature (Kelvin)\n# t2m_era5 : 2-m air temperature (Kelvin)\n# ssrd_era5 : Surface solar radiation downwards (W/m2)\n# pcwd_era5 : Potential cumulative water deficit (mm)\n# vegtype : Vegetation type\n\ndf_raw\n\n# A tibble: 101,199 × 18\n   site   date        flue is_flue_drought cluster   NR_B1 NR_B2   NR_B3  NR_B4\n   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 AR-Vir 2010-02-05 0.931 TRUE            cGR      0.0262 0.383  0.0139 0.0549\n 2 AR-Vir 2010-02-07 0.922 TRUE            cGR      0.0265 0.384  0.0144 0.0578\n 3 AR-Vir 2010-02-10 0.905 TRUE            cGR      0.0241 0.372  0.0145 0.0573\n 4 AR-Vir 2010-02-12 0.920 TRUE            cGR      0.0225 0.364  0.0132 0.0579\n 5 AR-Vir 2010-02-13 0.915 TRUE            cGR      0.0224 0.363  0.0132 0.0574\n 6 AR-Vir 2010-02-14 0.960 TRUE            cGR      0.0223 0.362  0.0131 0.0569\n 7 AR-Vir 2010-02-17 0.974 TRUE            cGR      0.0215 0.346  0.0132 0.0493\n 8 AR-Vir 2010-02-21 0.964 TRUE            cGR     NA      0.322 NA      0.046 \n 9 AR-Vir 2010-02-22 0.967 TRUE            cGR      0.0206 0.324 NA      0.0372\n10 AR-Vir 2010-02-23 0.972 TRUE            cGR      0.0232 0.343  0.0119 0.0382\n# ℹ 101,189 more rows\n# ℹ 9 more variables: NR_B5 &lt;dbl&gt;, NR_B6 &lt;dbl&gt;, NR_B7 &lt;dbl&gt;, LST &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   t2m_era5 &lt;dbl&gt;, ssrd_era5 &lt;dbl&gt;, pcwd_era5 &lt;dbl&gt;, vegtype &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   cluster_vegtype &lt;chr&gt;\nWe check for missing values in our data set:\nvisdat::vis_miss(df_raw, \n                 warn_large_data = F)\nNote that there are some missing values in the target and in the predictor values as illustrated above.

    "text": "2.2 Model training\nWith the data.frame df containing our training data we can thus start the model training.\nAs a first step, we want to create additional features by considering normalised difference indices between each band combinations, e.g. when applied to near-infrared and red this results in the widely used vegetation stress index NDVI. We define these features by generating for each band combination an expression nd_exprs and add these features in our recipe with the step step_mutate.\nIn our recipe we include other model preprocessing steps such as normalization and numeric encoding of vegetation types. Moreover, in our training data set only about a third of all values show stressed conditions (fLUE &lt; 1).
