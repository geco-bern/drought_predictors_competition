    "text": "1 Overview\nThis website serves as an introduction to the modelling challenge to estimate drought impacts on the light use efficiency of photosynthesis from multispectral remote sensing data. The modelling target are time series of the fractional reduction of the light use efficiency of photosynthesis, driven by soil moisture stress - termed fLUE. Time series are available from a set of sites and were generated by Stocker et al. (2018). The aim is to predict fLUE from multispectral remote sensing, paired with climate data and some limited site meta information.\nThe modelling challenge is devised as a competition where participants can submit their predictions of fLUE on a new set of sites that were not seen during model training. The submissions enter a leaderboard.\nThis modelling challenge and competition forms part of the course Applied Geodata Science 2, held at University of Bern (part of the Master programme in Geography and in Climate Sciences).\nThis modelling challenge (exercise) requires prior knowledge of programming in R, usage of git and Github, and a basis in supervised machine learning, covered in Chapters 10 and 11 of the free online book Applied Geodata Science."

    "text": "2.1 The challenge\nDroughts have far-reaching consequences for ecological and socio-economic systems. Different types of droughts are typically distinguished based on the variable in which a “drought” is expressed:\n\nPrecipitation: a shortage of precipitation can lead to a meteorological drought, particularly when occurring in a period with high radiation. Its identification and quantification relies on meteorological data.\nSoil moisture: a shortage of soil moisture can lead to a agricultural drought or soil moisture drought. Its identification and quantification can be based on soil moisture observations, data on yields in agriculture, or on estimates of vegetation greenness or primary production which is typically obtained from satellite remote sensing data.\nStreamflow: low streamflow is the basis for the identification of. a hydrological drought.\n\nIn this tutorial, we will focus on soil moisture droughts and its identification from satellite remote sensing data.\nDifferent types of remote sensing can be used to measure different aspects of the vegetated land surface and its response to droughts. A widely used approach is to consider vegetation greenness indices, derived from the imaging of multispectral reflectances, e.g., from the MODIS satellite mission. This mission has generated data products, e.g., of the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) at 250 m spatial resolution and an 8-day temporal resolution, covering years since 2000. Analyses of NDVI and EVI variations during droughts have been key for identifying and quantifying impacts of droughts on vegetation greenness, and therefore on primary productivity.\nHowever, a shortage of moisture across the rooting zone of plants can trigger effects on ecosystem functioning, including the assimilation of CO2 by photosynthesis or the transpiration of water vapor, long before effects are expressed in canopy structural changes through reduced greenness. Therefore, this physiological response is much harder to estimate from remote sensing data than the structural response.\nAn opportunity may lie in the effective use of the full information available from multispectral remote sensing, and by additionally pairing satellite remote sensing with climate data. Greenness indices such as the NDVI or EVI reduce the available spectral reflectance data of eight separate wavelength bands plus the thermal band available from MODIS to a single index. This implies a loss of information and a potential lack of representativity for drought impacts on ecosystem carbon and water balances. However, given sufficient training data, this information may be effectively exploited by data-driven models to estimate the physiological response – separate from the structural response.\nOf course, the training data for such models is a bottleneck. Measuring the physiological response of droughts – often invisible to the human eye and greenness indices – has to rely on other observation types that are not easily scalable in space. Such observations may be obtained at the leaf-level (e.g., gas exchange measurements), tree-level (e.g., sapflow or tree water deficit measurements), or ecosystem-level with limited spatial representativity (e.g., eddy-covariance measurements of ecosystem-atmosphere exchange fluxes)."

    "text": "2.2 Data\nHere, we make use of ecosystem-level data that is based on eddy covariance measurements and estimates the fractional reduction in the light use efficiency of ecosystem photosynthesis due to soil moisture stress (fLUE). These estimates are derived from the approach developed by B. D. Stocker et al. (2018). Data is available on Zenodo (B. Stocker 2018). The advantage of these data is that it provides continous observations over the course of several years, representative for canopy-integrated ecosystem-level fluxes, and available from a diverse set of sites, distributed across different climate zones and vegetation types in different regions globally.\nLet’s start by reading the data.\n\n# read data\ndf &lt;- read_rds(here(\"../data/competition2025_training_data.rds\"))\n\n# read site meta information\ndf_site_metainfo &lt;- read_csv(here(\"../data/fdk_site_info.csv\"))\n\nRows: 339 Columns: 15\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (5): sitename, koeppen_code, igbp_land_use, product, c3c4\ndbl (10): lon, lat, elv, year_start, year_end, canopy_height, reference_heig...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n# construct data frame containing site meta info for sites for which we have the data\n# note: for some sites missing information\ndf_sites &lt;- df |&gt; \n  select(site,  vegtype) |&gt; \n  distinct() |&gt; \n  left_join(\n    df_site_metainfo |&gt; \n      rename(site = sitename),\n    by = join_by(site)\n  )\n\nThe dataset df contains all the variables we use for model training.\nTarget:\n\nflue : fractional light use efficiency, a measure of soil moisture stress\n\nPredictors:\n\nNR_B1: Nadir reflectance in MODIS band 1, 620–670nm (-)\nNR_B2: Nadir reflectance in MODIS band 2, 841–876nm (-)\nNR_B3: Nadir reflectance in MODIS band 3, 459–479nm (-)\nNR_B4: Nadir reflectance in MODIS band 4, 545–565nm (-)\nNR_B5: Nadir reflectance in MODIS band 5, 1230–1250nm (-)\nNR_B6: Nadir reflectance in MODIS band 6, 1628–1652nm (-)\nNR_B7: Nadir reflectance in MODIS band 7, 2105–2155nm (-)\nLST : Land surface temperature (Kelvin)\nt2m_era5 : 2-m air temperature (Kelvin)\nssrd_era5 : Surface solar radiation downwards (W/m2)\npcwd_era5 : Potential cumulative water deficit (mm)\nvegtype : Vegetation type\n\nMeta data:\n\nsite : Fluxnet site name\ndate : date\nis_flue_drought : a flag for drought conditions based on fLUE\n\nThe meta data may be used for defining the model training.\nThe data has a certain structure.

Years of data covered by sites are not necessarily identical, but often overlap.\n\n\nCode\ndf |&gt; \n  filter(site %in% c(\"US-Ton\", \"CH-Lae\")) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(date, flue)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~site, ncol = 1) +\n  labs(x = \"Date\", y = \"fLUE (unitless)\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Time series of fLUE, given at two example sites (CH-Lae and US-Ton). This illustrates some typical features of fLUE: For a large part of all available dates across all sites, fLUE is near 1.0. It drops below 1.0 at some sites during the dry periods. At US-Ton, this happens during the summer months with recovery of values towards 1.0 towards the end of each calendar year.\n\n\n\n\nNext, let’s get an overview of the locations (based on lon and lat) and vegetation types from where data is available.\n\n\nCode\n# plot on world map\nworld &lt;- ne_countries(scale = \"medium\", returnclass = \"sf\")\n\nggplot() +\n  # world country outlines\n  geom_sf(data = world, fill = \"gray95\", color = \"gray70\", size = 0.2) +\n\n  geom_point(data = df_sites, aes(lon, lat, color = vegtype)) +\n\n  scale_color_batlowK(discrete = TRUE, name = \"\") +\n\n  # coordinate system (preserves lat/lon aspect)\n  coord_sf(\n    ylim = c(-60, 85),\n    expand = FALSE # to draw map strictly bounded by the specified extent\n  ) +\n\n  # labels and theme\n  labs(\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid = element_line(color = \"gray90\", size = 0.2),\n    legend.position = \"right\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Locations of sites (points) for which data is available.

That is, a site’s data is either fully in the validation fold or in the training fold, but never split up between them. In R caret, this can be implemented using\n\n\nfolds &lt;- caret::groupKFold(...)\n\ntraincntrlParams &lt;- caret::trainControl(\n  index = folds,\n  method = \"cv\"\n  ...\n  )\n\n\nThe dates with fLUE value substantially below are relatively sparse in our dataset. However, we want a model that does not miss these (ecologically consequential) water stress events. To overemphasise sparse data during model training, respective dates’ data can be duplicated. In our dataset, the logical variable is_flue_drought defines whether fLUE is substantially below 1.0. Use this as a basis for “upsampling” respective data with the function step_upsample() from the recipes package.\nThe model training and testing data can be obtained from the Git repository of this tutorial. To find it, follow the link by clicking on the Github icon in the menu bar, find the repository called drought_predictors_competition, owned by the Github organisation geco-bern. The respective files are called competition2025_training_data.rds and competition2025_testing_data.rds. Note that the testing data does not contain the column flue. This is the “truth” in our competition and is withheld from participants submitting their results.\nFill (impute) missing data. As long as you impute only predictor data based on other predictors’ values, you may do this beforehand, i.e. not as part of a model training “recipe”. KNN imputation often works well.\nDummy-encode categorical predictor variables"
